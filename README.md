# Lo Shu Grid Generator
 
## Overview

The **Lo Shu Grid Generator** is a Java application built using Core Java and Java Swing. It simplifies the process of generating a "Lo Shu Grid" based on a person's name and date of birth. This grid is a 3x3 matrix containing a unique sequence of digits from 1 to 9, which can be used by numerologists and enthusiasts to make predictions and gain insights into an individual's life.

## How It Works

1.	Launch the application to open an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
2.	Enter the person's name and date of birth into the provided input fields.
3.	Click the `Calculate` button.
4.	The program generates a 3x3 grid with a distinct sequence of numbers based on the input.
5.	Numerologists and individuals interested in numerology can analyze this grid to make predictions and interpretations quickly, saving time on manual calculations.
6.	Use the `Reset` button to clear the input fields and start a new prediction.

## Key Features

-  User-friendly Java Swing GUI for effortless input and output.
-  Generates a Lo Shu Grid with a unique number sequence for each input.
-  A valuable tool for numerologists, astrologers, and anyone intrigued by numerology.
